This is part of a website made to raise awarness and help with one of the UN Sustainable Development Goal (Responsible Consumption and Production) for my second year group project at Brunel University. The website was made with react and a MySQL databse.

This part of the website, that I was responsible for, is for companies to post their products (that classify as responsibly produced) and then to manage those posts.

This project is not functional right now since i don't currently have access to the database.
